# backEnd-E
Module 13 E-commerce assignment

## Description 
In this assignment I was tasked with creating backend code and connecting it to a database for an E-commerce site. There was already starter code and an exceptance criteria that we could use to help us, and that we had to follow. I got together with a couple of class mates and we worked through this assignment together. In this assignment we used ``MySQl2`` and some of ``sequelize'' to complete it.

## Usage 
Just take the route and put it into insomniac
